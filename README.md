Machine Learning Projects - Internship at CognoRise Infotech

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository showcases three machine learning projects I completed during my internship at CognoRise Infotech. These projects demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and interpretation, and were developed under the guidance of the CognoRise Infotech team.

Projects

1. House Price Prediction

- Predicting house prices based on various features such as number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.
- Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

1. Spam Email Detection

- Classifying emails as spam or non-spam using machine learning algorithms.
- Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy.

1. Diabetes Prediction

- Predicting the onset of diabetes based on patient characteristics and medical history.
- Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

About the Internship

During my internship at CognoRise Infotech, I had the opportunity to work on real-world machine learning problems and develop practical skills in data science. These projects showcase my learning and accomplishments during this period.

Repository Structure

Each project folder includes:

- A README file with project details and instructions.
- A Jupyter Notebook or Python script with the code.
- A dataset folder with the data used for the project.
- A results folder with visualizations and output.
